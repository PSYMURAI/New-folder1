        <p>
            <b>About Interaction</b><br>Over the last 21 years, the Computer Science Department at Modern College
            Ganeshkhind has been the driving force behind "Interaction," an intercollegiate event fostering a dynamic
            platform for student engagement.
            Year after year, this event has celebrated the spirit of innovation, competition, and camaraderie among
            students passionate about technology and creativity.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2rem">
            <b>Our Legacy:</b> <br> With a legacy spanning over two decades, Interaction has showcased a diverse range
            of competitions, including blind coding challenges, poster presentations, gaming tournaments, and more. Each
            year, our dedicated team
            organizes and hosts this extravaganza, shaping it into an event students eagerly anticipate.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2rem">
            <b>What to Expect:</b><br> Students participating in Interaction not only compete for certificates and
            trophies but also for the coveted Champions Trophy, awarded to the college that excels across multiple
            events. Exciting prizes await winners,
            motivating participants to showcase their skills and talents.

        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2rem">
            <b>Beyond Competition:</b><br> Interaction is not just about winning; it's about fostering a community where
            participants can network, learn, and grow. A scrumptious breakfast fuels the participants, while the games
            and challenges aim to ignite
            interest and enhance skills among the student community.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2rem">
            <b>Our Mission:</b><br> At Interaction, our primary goal is to cultivate an environment that not only
            encourages healthy competition but also ignites a passion for technology and innovation. Through these games
            and events, we aim to inspire
            students to explore their potential, hone their abilities, and nurture their enthusiasm for the
            ever-evolving world of technology. Join us this year as we continue our tradition of excellence,
            camaraderie, and innovation at Interaction, where
